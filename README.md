# shinyapp_project

Purpose:

The original intention to build this app is because I'm an adventurer, traveling all countries on the world is always been my dream and I want to create my own web page that can be designed by myself. And in this app I can add  all differnt kinds of inputs such as year, place. For output I can show map, text, image, video...etc.   

How can we do in this app: 

In this Shiny app, people can use the filter of time and continent to see when and where I have been. This app will be constantly updated as I travel more and more places. While you click on the video page, you will see a short introduction about Taiwan, which is my hometown. I hope to introduce it to more people and let people know Taiwan is a small but culturally rich country.
